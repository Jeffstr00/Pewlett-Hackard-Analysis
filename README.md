# Pewlett Hackard: Employee Database with SQL

## Overview

Pewlett Hackard is a large company who is looking to navigate the waters where employees from the baby boomer area are beginning to retire at an increased rate.  They need to know which current employees are likely to retire so that they can both handle retirement packages and try to ensure that they are in a good position to move forward when they need to fill those newly created vacancies instead of being caught with their pants down.  PH currently has their employee information scattered throughout six seperate CSV files, but due to the overwhelmingly large amount of data being dealt with, they are looking to move things into SQL databases.
